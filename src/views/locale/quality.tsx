The model is instructed to use these exact translations — no paraphrasing, no contextual alternatives, no synonyms. A keepUppercase flag preserves casing when the same term appears in different cases across the document. Glossary entries can be imported from CSV, TSV, XLSX, or TMX files.",

Segments that exactly match a TM entry are used verbatim with no LLM call — guaranteeing consistency and saving cost. Partial matches are presented to the model as high-confidence reference examples, guiding phrasing, register, and terminology continuity across long documents.",

Project-level Style Guides define tone, register, formatting conventions, and brand-specific language rules. Multiple guides are combined (up to 2,000 characters) and injected into every segment's system prompt. They sit below DNT, Glossary, and TM in priority — meaning they shape style and voice without ever overriding approved terminology.",

    body: "Before any LLM call is made, Contentech runs a zero-cost in-process scan over every segment in the document. It extracts all 1–4-word n-gram candidates, counts how many distinct segments each candidate appears in, filters to terms present in at least two segments, removes sub-phrases dominated by longer phrases, and returns the top 30 by segment frequency. These terms are injected into every segment's system prompt as a mandatory consistency block — the model is explicitly told to translate each recurring term the same way throughout the entire document. No manual setup required; it runs automatically on every job.",

    body: "Translation coherence breaks when each segment is processed in isolation. Contentech gives every segment visibility into its two preceding and two following segments as labelled [CONTEXT] blocks. The model translates only the marked [TARGET] segment but uses the surrounding text for pronoun agreement, register continuity, and terminology consistency. Table cells are restricted to context from within the same table to prevent column-header confusion bleeding into cell translations. Document-level headers and footers are translated independently to avoid their register infecting body text.",

    body: "Enterprise clients bring their own brand voice, industry specialisation, and product terminology. Contentech accepts an optional website URL, industry sector, and brand biography per organisation and per client account. These are injected as a sandboxed UNTRUSTED REFERENCE block — the model can adapt its register, domain framing, and tone, but the block is explicitly labelled as low-priority so it cannot override glossary terms, DNT entries, TM matches, or style guides above it in the chain. Client-account context always wins over organisation-level context when both are populated.",

    tagline: "The right model for every document type, with automatic failover.",
    body: "Not every language model performs equally across domains. A model optimised for marketing copy may produce fluent but imprecise output for a legal contract. Contentech's routing engine analyses the detected document type — Legal, Medical, Financial, Technical, Marketing, or General — and routes each job to the provider and model best suited for that domain, following a configurable priority-ordered rule chain. If the primary provider is unreachable or returns an error, automatic fallback chains ensure continuity across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere, and Moonshot.",

Are all protected terms (DNT entries, placeholders, codes) intact and unchanged? Is the full meaning preserved with no omissions, additions, or distortions? Is the output fluent and natural-sounding in the target language? Are all formatting elements — markdown, HTML tags, placeholders, number and date formats — preserved correctly? This self-verification step materially reduces hallucination rates and formatting errors without any added runtime overhead.",

The editor presents source and target side-by-side with glossary terms highlighted, TM matches surfaced inline, and segment-by-segment approval or rejection controls. Linguists can add inline comments, flag segments for rework, and track changes across revision rounds. Only after human sign-off does a job status advance to Complete — ensuring every delivered file carries individual human certification.",

The next job that touches the same or similar content benefits immediately: exact matches bypass the LLM at zero cost, and partial matches accelerate the human review step with high-confidence suggestions. Over time, every project's TM grows into a precision asset that compounds quality and reduces cost with each translation cycle — with no manual maintenance, exports, or imports required.",
